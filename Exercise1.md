This exercise covers Chapters `1-31` of `A Smarter Way to Learn Javascript`

## Question 1

Given an array of strings, convert each string into:
* uppercase if first letter is capital
* lowercase if first letter is small

```javascript

var arr = ['This', 'is', 'My', 'first', 'piece', 'OF', 'javaScript'];

// your code

```
The variable `arr` should be now: `["THIS", "is", "MY", "first", "piece", "OF", "javascript"]`

## Question 2

Given an array of sentences, capitalize first letter of every word and lowercase every other letter of each sentence.

```javascript

var arr = ['heLlO woRlD', 'i like JavaScript', 'my name Is kHaN'];
// your magic

```
The variable `sen1` should now be `['Hello World', 'I Like Javascript', 'My Name Is Khan']`


## Question 3

Given a string, count the number of vowels (`'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'`) occurred in it.

```javascript

var str = 'Hello Ahmed!';
var numberOfVowels = 0;
// your منتر

```
The variable `numberOfVowels` should be `4`. How? There are four vowels in this string: `'e'`, `'o'`, `'A'` and `'e'`

## Question 4

Given a string, push the ASCII code of each alphabet (`A` to `Z` or `a` to `z`) to an array. Disregard the character which is not an alphabet.

```javascript

var str = 'He said: Javascript is a mess!';
var myArr = [];

// your code

```

The variable `myArr` should be: 
`[72, 101, 115, 97, 105, 100, 74, 97, 118, 97, 115, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 105, 115, 97, 109, 101, 115, 115]`

## Question 5

We need to verify that we got the correct output in the previous question. Since we are programmers, we have a way! 

Javascript provides a function [String.fromCharCode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode)
You will need that!


Given the variable `myArr` in the previous question, convert each number into its corresponding ASCII character. For e.g: `65` should be converted to `'A'`.

```javascript

var myArr = [72, 101, 115, 97, 105, 100, 74, 97, 118, 97, 115, 99, 114, 105, 112, 116, 105, 115, 97, 109, 101, 115, 115];

// your solution

```

The variable `myArr` should now be equal to:
`['H', 'e', 's', 'a', 'i', 'd', 'J', 'a', 'v', 'a', 's', 'c', 'r', 'i', 'p', 't', 'i', 's', 'a', 'm', 'e', 's', 's']`

## Question 6

We are building an email system for Saylani Mass Training. We need to generate a list of emails from a given list of students' names.

An email will not contain any capital alphabets.

A name consists of a `First Name` and `Last Name` separated by a space. You have to convert it to an email like this:

`Muhammad Ali` -> `muhammad.ali@saylani.org`

`ahsan Bashir` -> `ahsan.bashir@saylani.org`

If the `length` of `First Name`is greater than `8`, just use the initial letter of `First Name`. For example: 

`Azarafrooz Hameed` -> `a.hameed@saylani.org`

Write a program that accepts a single parameter which is an array of students' names, and outputs an array of emails.

```javascript

var names = ['Muhammad Ali', 'ahsan Bashir', 'Azarafrooz Hameed'];
var emails = [];
// your program
 
```

The variable `emails` should be now: 

`['muhammad.ali@saylani.org', 'ahsan.bashir@saylani.org', 'a.hameed@saylani.org']`

Bonus Question: Disallow any special characters and produce `'Invalid Email'` instead of an actual email.


## Question 7

Generate a list/array of all the alphabets (capital & small)

```javascript
var alphabets = [];
// your code
```
The variable `alphabets` should look like `['A', 'B', ... , 'Z', 'a', 'b', ..., 'z']`

No character other than an alphabet is allowed! Only Alphabets!

## Question 8

You have learnt how to generate random numbers, round up/down numbers and use the `prompt` function
to ask something from the user. Let's put it all on use!

Create a guessing game in which you ask the user to enter an integer and tell him whether his guess
was equal to the integer generated by our code.

Only integers between 0-10(inclusive) are allowed from the user. If the user enters a floating point number or any character other than an integer, console or alert `'Invalid input'`. 

```javascript
var userGuess = prompt('Guess an integer between 0 and 10 which I am thinking:');
// your code
```

If `userGuess` matches our random integer, tell him (on the console or in alert):

```
You guessed it right!
```

If `userGuess` did not match our random integer, the output should be:

```
Wrong guess! I was thinking 4
```

If `userGuess` was something like `'Hello world'` or `3.233` or anything invalid, inform him:

```
Invalid input
```
