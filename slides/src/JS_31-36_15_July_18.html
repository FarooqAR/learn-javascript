# Date

To get the local time and date, we call the `Date()` function with the `new` keyword.

```javascript
var date = new Date();
console.log(date); 
// Tue Jul 10 2018 22:40:48 GMT+0500 (Pakistan Standard Time)
```

The `new` keyword does some magic which will be discussed in Advanced JS.

---

# What you can do with Date?

There are many useful functions you can perform with `new Date()`, for example:

```javascript
var date = new Date();
```

`date.getDate()` will give you an integer from `1` to `31`, telling the day of the month.

Explore other functions like `getDay`, `getHours`, `getYear` etc. on your own.

---

# Timestamp

The number of milliseconds passed since 1st Jan 1970. It helps us calculate difference between two dates.

You can get the timestamp at any given date by using `date.getTime()`, its result will look something like:
```javascript
1531324146714
```

---

# Setting date and time

One way is to pass a valid date string directly into `Date()`, like this:
```javascript
new Date('January 01, 1970')
```
You can also pass the timestamp:
```javascript
new Date(1531324146714)
```
Functions like `setMonth`, `setYear`, `setHours` etc. can be used to set different aspects of date individually.

# Functions

A set of instructions that you can re use again and again to avoiding repitition. Suppose I want to 
capitalize some strings and push them into an array:
```javascript
var someArray = [];
someArray.push('saylani'.toUpperCase());
```
But It would be messy and tedious to do that for every string. We can use functions to re use the above
code.

---

# Functions

```javascript
function capAndPush ( str ) {
  someArray.push(str.toUpperCase());
}
```
Now, I just have to provide this function a string using the syntax below:
```javascript
capAndPush('saylani');
capAndPush('hello');
capAndPush('world');
```

---

# Functions

A function is made up of four things:
1. A `function` keyword
2. A function name. E.g: `capAndPush` in previous slide.
3. An input (also called a parameter).E.g:  `str` in previous slide.
4. Some code inside curly braces `{}`. Also called a block.

Let's go back and see the syntax again.

---

# Function Parameters

Consider this function:

```javascript
function sayHello ( name, message ) {
  alert('Hi ' + name + ', ' + message);
}
```

`name` and `message` are called parameters.
Think of them as normal variables. These variables
get assigned the values you pass when you call the function like this:
```javascript
sayHello ('Farooq', 'Welcome to JS!');
```

---

What if you don't pass the values? Like this?
```javascript
sayHello()
```
The alert will show:
`
Hi undefined, undefined
`

In Javascript, function parameters are optional. If you don't pass the value,
they get `undefined`

In the previous slide, `'Farooq'` and `'Welcome to JS!'` are also called 
arguments.

---

# Function: Output

Your function can also give back a value:

```javascript
function getAge () {
  return 40;
}
```
```javascript
var age = getAge();
console.log(age); // 40
```
You have seen functions like `capAndPush` and `sayHello` in the previous slides. 
What did they return?

---

```javascript
function uselessFunction ( name ) {
  return name;
}
```
```javascript
uselessFunction('Saylani'); // ??
```
What does the above function call returns?

Okay, let's get a little tough. What does this return?

```javascript
uselessFunction(uselessFunction(34 - 4));
```
